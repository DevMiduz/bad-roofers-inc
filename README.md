A website dedicated to exposing the bad workmanship of Lancashire Roofing Limited featuring Lee Schofield and Will Smith.

Back in March 2022, both Lee Schofield (from Euxton) and Will Smith (from Leyland) were hired through the company of Lancashire Roofing Limited. They were hired to do a full re-roof including plastic work. To this date the property is left with an unfinished roof, which is both poor quality and has hazardous improperly secured lead work. They were given several chances to fix the issues, so it should be noted that the current roof is with "corrected" workmanship. In most cases, instead of fixing the issues, they did their best to hide the issues. Both photographic and video evidence is available of this. Three roofing companies have examined and given reports confirming the work is of extremely poor quality, with sections being hazardous to the occupants. 

Lancashire Roofing Limited were originally hired by a neighbour to do a re-roof. Lee Schofield and Will Smith were very friendly and easy to approach. The pair were local with Lee Schofield being from Euxton and Will Smith being from Leyland. It was assumed with them being local that they'd be less likely to try and rip us off. We were wrong. From a distance it looked as though they had done a good job. Their speed for a two man team seemed admirably. It was only at a later date, when the work was inspected closer, that this speed was attributed to bad practices and the cutting of corners. 

Here is a list from three independent roof inspections, all of which agreed that this is required to get the roof into a fit state:

- Complete realignment of gauge spacing on battens.
- Correct nailing of all tiles.
- Dry ridge realignment and fixing properly.
- Re-coating of front and back flat roofs.
- Removal and replacement of flat roofs to stop pooling.
- UPVC boxing of cladding for ends front and back.
- Top layer of shingles front and back missing.
- Removal of bottom layer of shingles to cover wood with lead to correct lead work.
- Re-fixing ridge tiles, spacers, and membrane.
- All lead work to be replaced completed with proper fixings.
- Remove and reuse existing tiles and fix with new fixings.
- Replacement of damaged membrane.
- All scaffolding required included.
- Arrange site clearance and removal of all debris

For those who want are in a rush... For all your roofing needs be sure to STAY CLEAR OF LANCASHIRE ROOFING LIMITED, LEE SCHOFIELD, AND WILL SMITH. If you have had work done by Lancashire Roofing Limited, Lee Schofield, or Will Smith, then we recommend you get an independent inspection or survey done to avoid a horrible surprise in the future. The whole experience from start to finish will be covered on this website and images are available in the gallery.
