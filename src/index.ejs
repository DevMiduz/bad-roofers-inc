			<p>
				Back in March 2022, both <b>Lee Schofield</b>
				(from Euxton) and <b>Will Smith</b> (from Leyland) were hired through the company of <b>Lancashire Roofing
					Limited</b>.
				They were hired to do a full re-roof including plastic work. To this date the property is left with
				an unfinished roof,
				which is both poor quality and has hazardous improperly secured lead work.
				They were given several chances to fix the issues, so it should be noted that the current roof is with "corrected"
				workmanship.
				In most cases, instead of fixing the issues, they did their best to hide the issues. Both <b>photographic and video
					evidence</b> is available of this.
				Three roofing companies have examined and given reports confirming the work is of <b>extremely poor quality</b>,
				with sections being <b>hazardous</b> to the occupants.

				<b>Lancashire Roofing Limited</b> were originally hired by a neighbour to do a re-roof.
				<b>Lee Schofield</b> and <b>Will Smith</b> were very friendly and easy to approach.
				The pair were local with <b>Lee Schofield</b> being from <b>Euxton</b> and <b>Will Smith</b> being from <b>Leyland</b>.
				It was assumed with them being local that they'd be less likely to try and rip us off.
				<b>We were wrong</b>.
				From a distance it looked as though they had done a good job. Their speed for a two man team 
				seemed admirably. It was only at a later date, when the work was inspected closer, that this 
				speed was attributed to <b>bad practices</b> and the <b>cutting of corners</b>.
