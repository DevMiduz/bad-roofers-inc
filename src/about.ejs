                  Back in March 2022, both <b>Lee Schofield</b>
                  (from Euxton) and <b>Will Smith</b> (from Leyland) were hired through the company of <b>Lancashire
                    Roofing
                    Limited</b>.
                  They were hired to do a full re-roof including plastic work. To this date the property is left with
                  an unfinished roof,
                  which is both poor quality and has hazardous improperly secured lead work.
                  They were given several chances to fix the issues, so it should be noted that the current roof is with
                  "corrected"
                  workmanship.
                  In most cases, instead of fixing the issues, they did their best to hide the issues. Both
                  <b>photographic and video
                    evidence</b> is available of this.
                  Three roofing companies have examined and given reports confirming the work is of <b>extremely poor
                    quality</b>,
                  with sections being <b>hazardous</b> to the occupants.
                </p>
